This is the Sentiment Analysis of Coffee Tweets Shiny App for PHP 2560 by Erin Bugbee, Sarah Fringer, and Amy Liu.

The link to our video explaining our App is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V560emQMtpw&feature=youtu.be).

When first using the app, you may be asked to authenticate in order to access the tweets. Respond with a "1" to denote "Yes".

Sometimes, an error may occur stating "Warning: Error in check_twitter_oauth: OAuth authentication error". This is due to the interaction with the Twitter API for security reasons and is not a problem with the application. Close R and wait a few minutes, then try again.
